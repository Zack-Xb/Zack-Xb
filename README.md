Greetings

I'm Zack, currently a student at the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/) studying Maths and Computer Science and working at [Simply Staking](https://simplystaking.com/) taking care of node infrastructure and developing new platforms.

Mainly building a privacy preserving self custodial wallet [Avail](https://github.com/AvailX) with the aim of giving anyone frictionless control of their money through a private decentralised economy.
