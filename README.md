Greetings

I'm Zack, currently a student at the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/) studying Maths and Computer Science and working at [Simply Staking](https://simplystaking.com/) taking care of node infrastructure and developing new platforms.

I also founded [ApplabMt](https://applab.com.mt/) alongside [Giorgio Grigolo](https://github.com/girogio) which was a great learning experience in multiple facets of life.

Avail.
